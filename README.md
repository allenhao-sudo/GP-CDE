# GP_CDE
Python implementation of the GP-assisted two-phase constrained differential evolution

## Requirements

1. numpy 

2. gpytorch 

3. scipy 

4. matlab.engine

Please note that the CEC test problems are implemented by matlab, and some configurations need to be done to call __matlab__ in __python__. Please refer to https://ww2.mathworks.cn/help/matlab/matlab-engine-for-python_zh_CN.html for relevant configurations
